## Exercise

Using a hash map and vectors, create a text interface to allow a user to add employee names to a department in a company.
For example, “Add Sally to Engineering” or “Add Amir to Sales”.
Then let the user retrieve a list of all people in a department or all people in the company by department, sorted alphabetically.
